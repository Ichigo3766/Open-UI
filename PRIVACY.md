# Open UI Privacy Policy 

Effective date: 2026-02-24

Open UI is an open‑source mobile client for Open WebUI. This app acts as a client to a server you choose and configure. This policy describes how the app itself handles data on your device. Your configured server may collect, process, and store data under its own policies; please review your server's privacy terms separately.

## Information We Collect
- **Device-stored data:** minimal settings and preferences (e.g., theme, appearance options, server configurations) saved locally on your device.
- **Authentication tokens:** stored securely on your device using the iOS Keychain when you sign in to your chosen server.
- **User-provided content:** messages, files, images, and voice input you choose to send are transmitted directly from your device to your configured server. The app does not operate its own backend.
- **Diagnostic information:** transient error logs in memory for troubleshooting within a session. The app does not include third‑party analytics.

## How We Use Information
- Operate core features such as chat, file uploads, voice calls, and text-to-speech.
- Remember your preferences, server connections, and sign‑in state on this device.
- Improve reliability (e.g., displaying error information to you).

## Data Storage and Transfer
- **Local storage:** preferences, conversation history, and credentials are stored on your device. Access tokens are stored using the iOS Keychain.
- **Network transfer:** when you interact with the app, your data is sent to the server you configured. The app does not send your data to any developer‑controlled servers.

## Permissions
Depending on how you use Open UI, the app may request:
- **Microphone:** to capture voice input for voice calls and speech recognition.
- **Photos/Files:** to let you pick and upload attachments.
- **Speech Recognition:** to transcribe your voice input on-device.
- **Network access:** to connect to your configured server.
- **Notifications:** to alert you of new messages or updates.

## Third‑Party Services
The app does not include third‑party analytics or advertising SDKs. Your configured server or AI models you use may rely on third‑party services subject to their own terms.

## Security
We use the iOS Keychain for sensitive credentials and follow platform security best practices. No security can be guaranteed; protect access to your device and server credentials.

## Data Retention
- **On device:** preferences, cached data, and conversation history may persist until you clear app data or uninstall. You can revoke sign‑in by logging out.
- **On server:** retention is determined by the server you use; consult that server's policy.

## Your Choices
- You can change servers, log out, or clear app data in your device settings.
- You can choose not to grant optional permissions; some features may not work without them.
- You can delete individual conversations or all local data from within the app.

## Children's Privacy
Open UI is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). Do not use the app if you do not meet the applicable age requirements.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. Material changes will be reflected in the app bundle and version notes.
